# Newport Sidewalk Map

This dataset will capture pedestrian rights of way, such as sidewalks and crosswalks. It treats vehicle roads as barriers. **This is currently an incomplete dataset!** It is still under development.

The source data for the map is from ground surveys, using [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) for geographic reference. 

`npt-sidewalks.geojson` is a map of all sidewalks.

`npt-sidewalk-street-intersections.geojson` is a derived dataset generated by taking the line intersections of `npt-sidewalks.geojson` and the [RIGIS-RIDOT-roads](https://github.com/NewportDataPortal/RIGIS-RIDOT-roads) dataset, with manual corrections for overpasses. Crossings are not necessarily marked. **This is currently an incomplete dataset!** Please use for guidance only.
